# CANguru Bridge

This repository builds the [CANguru Bridge](https://github.com/CANguru-System/10-Aktuelle-OTA-Versionen/tree/master/01-CANguru-Bridge-Olimex-%20Version%202.0%20large%20LCD) code from on GitHub Actions.

Using the CANguru Bridge, one can expose the CAN bus of a MÃ¤rklin "Digital-Anschlussbox" (also called "Gleisbox") over the network, so that computers can access it over the network.

## Required hardware

The hardware used by the author of the CANguru Bridge is [Olimex ESP32-EVB](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32/ESP32-EVB/open-source-hardware) but it might also work with generic ESP32 boards connected to a generic CAN bus transceiver such as the SN65HVD230 VP230 (not tested yet).

## Connections
